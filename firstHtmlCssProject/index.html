              <p>My name is Pranay, I’m a mexican living in Belgium for almost 8 years now.
                As a ninja I am 100% made in Belgium.
                I learned everything about coffee here and I am very proud to represent Belgium at the WBC. Belgium is my second home.
                I’ve being always interested in coffee but it is only a few years ago that I discover this passion of mine called specialty coffee.
                My favorite drink is espresso.
                I just love this powerful full of flavor drink and the whole process behind it.

              <h3>Pranay</h3>
              <p>In 2003, my path changed working as a Human Resource consultant, starting on a new carrier.
                For 15 years I worked as a pasty chef and a confectioner and for 8 years I worked at Technical college as a lecture within the baking industry.
                I like to create things with my hands – building quality and craftmanship into my work.
                When I started my own company in 2012, these were the pivot points beyond my philosophy I wanted to create and share with my costumers and one of the reasons why the Roastry, coffeeshop and my Academy is bound together and called GreatCoffee.
                I like to compete because this sharpen my own perception of coffee and giving me inspiration personally and professional to learn something new.

            <p>
              It’s just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.<br><br>
              But it’s a connection.
              <br><br>
              We make sure everything we do honours that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.
              <br><br>
              From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.
              When we set about opening Talking Beans we wanted to do something special. We wanted a coffeehouse in the grand European tradition and asked Paris-based designer Elliot Barnes to help us.
              <br><br>Between us, we designed the concept and procured the materials for the superb finish you see in Fixx today. Elliot describes the design inspiration:
              <br><br>“An updated Proustian notion of recollection informs a subtle blend of materials, finishes and objects from the realm of coffee. When experienced together or individually, as when one tastes or smells a brew, they stimulate the memory of various moments in a life.”
              <br><br>Our inspiration was simpler. We just wanted to become THE place in Delhi for coffee.<br><br>
